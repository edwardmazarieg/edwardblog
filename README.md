The map I chose was a general Hispanic population map across the United States from the Pew research center. I chose this map in particular because I am interested in the Hispanic population as I am also Hispanic and it is interesting to see a map projection about a racial population in this country. First, just take into consideration that this is from 2014 so it is a bit dated now. We see that this map image uses hue and area with an interval and ratio level of measurement as the different color shades have their own meaning and because it has a high and most informative scale than most 1-dimensional maps, and the area is where these concentrations are placed on the map of the U.S. Above all, this map is interactive which is always a great educational tool. The link above shows. What I like most about it is that it is showing the 60 largest metropolitan areas by Hispanic population. We can directly see just by hovering our mouse over the state, that California for example has a population under 18 years old that identity as Hispanic being 52% in contrast to North Dakota where the number is only 4%. Not only can we know that, but a cause that the map provides for this is simply the amount of Hispanics in each state. The number makes more sense when we find out that California has 14.9 million Hispanics and North Dakota has 18 thousand. The legend in use is advanced as a whole because not only does it specify what the colors mean in terms of Latinos/Hispanics as a percent of the population but the interactive aspect brings in more information to be explored. 
       A critique I would give to the map through all that it provides is some sort of scale that explains the relationship of the data frame extent to the real world when clicking on each state. It can have a close-up view of the state and show a scale of the different high Hispanic populations within those counties to measure how far away each community is from one another. This change or tweak can tell us even more about the Hispanic community such as wealth disparages relative to the white neighborhoods and how gentrifying has placed the Latinos geographically. I personally know that Latinos in the Los Angeles area have been gentrified to move to central valley areas like Palmdale and Bakersfield. Another change can be to include a political identity section because this also gives more perspective to how the Latino community thinks in this country at least politically. Other than that I think this map does a great job in including many social aspects in the Latino community which makes this map very extensive.
